- Open one of the sub projects in Android Studio
- Find puzzlers in each module
- Read comment in `MainActivity` describing what you need to figure out
- Solve as many puzzlers as you can!
- Share your results with link to this repo by mentioning [`@lyfteng`](https://twitter.com/lyfteng)
- You can solve puzzlers with the whole team and use it as a little teambuilding event ðŸ˜½
- Good luck and have fun!

## Explanations

We're going to publish explanations of why and how puzzlers work in our [Engineering Blog](https://eng.lyft.com/), you can follow it on [Medium](https://eng.lyft.com/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lyfteng)
